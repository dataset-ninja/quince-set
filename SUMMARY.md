The dataset consists of 1515 images with 17171 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *unripe* and *ripe*.

Images in the QuinceSet dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2022 by the [Institute of Horticulture, Latvia](https://www.lbtu.lv/en/institute-of-horticulture-0) and [Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Lsatvia](https://www.edi.lv/en/).
